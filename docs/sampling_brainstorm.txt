Monthly query limits:
50 full-archive requests,
5000 total tweets
(100 tweets / request)

Problem: Random sampling may give us data from a time period of relatively little price movement.
* Though a lot of sentiment could prove that a stock doesn't respond during this period.
Basically do we want to identify stock price as a result of sentiment, or sentiment not indicating
change in stock price?

Solution: Stratified sampling
Identify periods of signifigant movement in stock price, sample periods before
these dates.

Problem: There are many tweets, and a pull at any given time will result in tweets from
basically that exact time (probably within a minute).

Solution: Control for this by testing at a set time (week granularity) (maybe wednesday at 5:00pm EST?)

How many pulls / company?
We have 5x the queries available for the past 30 days.
10 / company at select times? 5 for positive trends 5 for negative?

*Separate test for finer granularity (leveraging past-30 day info)?

3 Strata:
    - stock up (+10% last week)
    - stock down (-10% last week)
    - no movement (< 10%+- last week)
